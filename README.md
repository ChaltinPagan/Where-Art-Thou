# Where Art Thou

## About

New York City is home to over a thousand art galleries, presenting diverse and beautiful art in every imaginable discipline. Art galleries are great places to see art because they are always free to visit.

Exposure to art is important. Art makes you think. Art makes you feel. You don’t need language to understand it. Art says things words can’t say. 

We created **Where ART Thou** with the vision that discovering new and amazing art is only a click away. 

**Where ART Thou** connects NYC residents and tourists to local galleries near them. With an easy to use interface, our app allows users to search for art galleries by simply typing in their zip code.
